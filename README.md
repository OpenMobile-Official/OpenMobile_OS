# OpenMobile_OS
This is just the files for my open source rpi/sbc os made for 3.5 inch touchscreens. This is still in development.


# This is still in development, there is no apps preinstalled. No point setting it up now.

Currently to run it:
1. Download the files
2. Install raspbian os lite
3. Install Python and pygame
4. Extract the files to the folder where you want the files stored
5. If your using a touch (like the 3.5 this was origionally designed for), install the firmware
6. A command to run on boot to load the UI in the framebuffer
7. Follow the set up prompt

# New version release: B.0.1

This includes a new appstore, notification system which allows for showing bannar notifications, dialogue and messages in the desktop, finally a new personal assistant named kit.

More documentation will be released on a later date.
