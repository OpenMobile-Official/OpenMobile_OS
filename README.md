# OpenMobile_OS
This is just the files for my open source rpi/sbc os made for touchscreens. This is still in development.

Currently to run it:
1. Download the files
2. Install raspbian os lite
3. Install Python and pygame
4. Extract the files to the folder where you want the files stored
5. If your using a touch (like the 3.5 this was origionally designed for), install the firmware
6. A command to run on boot to load the UI
7. Follow the set up prompt

I will eventually release an image file. Not now though as I am going on a trip
